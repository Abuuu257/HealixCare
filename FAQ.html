                    <div class="FAQ_answers">
                    At HealixCare, we understand that situations can change, and you may need to cancel or reschedule your appointment. Our cancellation policy is as follows:

                    Cancellation Notice: We kindly ask that you provide at least 24 hours' notice if you need to cancel or reschedule your appointment. This allows us to accommodate other patients who may need care.
                        
                    Late Cancellations: If you cancel less than 24 hours before your appointment, a cancellation fee may apply. This fee helps cover the cost of the reserved time slot.
                        
                    No-Show Policy: If you do not show up for your appointment and do not provide any notice, a no-show fee will be charged to your account. Repeated no-shows may result in limited access to booking future appointments.
                        
                    How to Cancel: You can cancel or reschedule your appointment by calling us at (123) 456-7890 or by emailing appointments@healixcare.com. Our team will assist you with the process.
                        
                    We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in helping us manage our appointment schedule effectively.</div>
